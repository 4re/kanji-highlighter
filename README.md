kanji-highlighter
=================

Greasemonkey userscript that highlights kanji on websites, based on their level of familiarity. The script is optimized for people who follow a set order in which they learn the kanji and by default matches the levels of the [WaniKani] website.

## TODO

* Implement an options dialog via GM_config
* Allow the user to configure the highlight scheme more thoroughly
* Add more useful tools and statistics related to kanji
* (Maybe) add support for vocabulary via language parsing
